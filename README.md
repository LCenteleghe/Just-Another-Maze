# Just-Another-Maze

This is an basic isometric 2D game. In this game you are a guy that found himself lost in a ghost city, 
the main goal of the game is to find a portal to get back home, but this portal is inside a tough maze. And there is another problem you should be worried about, you carry a lantern and this lantern is running out of fuel, and if it loses its flame you will be trapped forever in the darkness. 
Fortunately, you can find some extra fuel inside chests ;D.

## Some features of the game:

- It uses a map engine that can read the map from a xml generated by the software Tiled (http://www.mapeditor.org/)
- Using this software you can dynamicaly add doors, chests, and other  objects to the game.
- It's made using purely Java and a little bit of OpenGL.

It's not a final product (not yet ha-ha), It's just a good code if you are interested in a game that uses almost no external libraries.
